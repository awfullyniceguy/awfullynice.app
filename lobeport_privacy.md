Privacy Policy for LobePort

Effective Date: October 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how LobePort ("the App") manages the permissions you grant and your privacy. We are committed to your privacy and believe that you should control your own data.

1. Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information or usage data from your use of the App.

LobePort is designed to perform its functions entirely on your device. Any information you create or process within the App (such as photos, videos, or audio recordings) remains solely on your device, under your control.

2. Permissions Requested

The App requests access to the following device permissions solely for the purpose of enabling the Appâ€™s core functionality:

Permission

Purpose

Data Handling

Camera

To allow you to take photos and record videos within the App.

Data is processed on-device and never transmitted to our servers.

Microphone

To allow you to record audio while recording videos within the App.

Data is processed on-device and never transmitted to our servers.

Photos/Media Library

To allow you to save photos and videos created in the App, or to access existing media for processing.

We only access the specific media you select to save or modify. We do not scan or collect the contents of your library.

Crucially, none of the data accessed via these permissions is stored on our servers, analyzed for tracking purposes, or shared with third parties.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Because we do not collect any personal data or usage data, we have no data to share or disclose.

We do not share any data with advertisers or marketing companies.

We do not sell any data.

We do not use third-party analytics or tracking tools that collect personal data.

4. Security

Since all data remains on your device, the security of your data is governed by your device's security features (such as encryption and biometric locking). The App does not implement its own server-side security measures because it has no serverside data to protect.
